## Blitzkarte
This project is an overhaul of a previous full stack app of the same name and intent. Leveraging Express over Django REST for increased control direct database manipulation, this revamp should prove to be a much more streamlined and efficient program than its predecessor.

## Sever Side (Erzahler)
This repo stores the server side implementation of a full stack app which allows users to play a fascinating game of global domination.

The server side will be responsible for storing the game state regarding the world map and status of all nations and units, etc. Leveraging Firebase for authentication/authorization, users will rightly only be able to access the information that the rules dictate they should.

## Technologies
Express.js
Firebase
